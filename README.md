# Alex Cantor

Cybersecurity student, competitor, and builder.

My work centers on understanding how systems fail under real adversarial pressure, and turning that understanding into practical defenses, tooling, and documentation.

## Focus Areas

- Web Exploitation
- Attack/Defense environments and competition-style infrastructure
- Linux and Windows system hardening and auditing
- Binary exploitation (PWN) and reverse engineering
- Security automation and scripting
- Detection engineering, logging, and incident response workflows

## Competitions & Results

My goal is to build depth, not noise — and to leave systems measurably more secure than I found them.
